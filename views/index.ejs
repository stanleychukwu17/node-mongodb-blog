                    Muhammadu Buhari GCFR (born 17 December 1942) is a Nigerian politician who has been president of Nigeria since 2015. Buhari is a retired Nigerian Army Major General and served as military head of state from 1983 to 1985, after taking power in a military coup d'état.[2][3]
                    The term Buharism is ascribed to the authoritarian policies of his military regime.[4][5] Buhari has said that he takes responsibility for anything over which he presided during his military rule, and that he cannot change the past. He has described himself as a "converted democrat".[6]
